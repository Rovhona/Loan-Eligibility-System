# 🏦 Loan Eligibility System

A full-stack loan eligibility assessment app that simulates how banks evaluate loan applications based on income, expenses, credit score, and employment status. Built with Next.js and Supabase, it replicates the type of internal tool used by financial institutions like FNB or Standard Bank.
